Simulink Project for Battery Thermal Management with SOC and Temperature Monitoring

# Battery Thermal Management Simulation

## Project Description
This Simulink project demonstrates the thermal management of a table-based battery under controlled current conditions. The model includes:
- A controlled current source supplying current to the battery.
- A table-based battery model.
- A bus selector to output State of Charge (SOC), Voltage, and Current to a scope.
- A convective heat transfer block to simulate thermal effects during charging and discharging.
- Temperature monitoring of the battery to observe the increase in temperature as SOC decreases.

## Features
- Simulates battery charging and discharging with thermal management.
- Monitors SOC, Voltage, and Current in real-time.
- Uses convective heat transfer to model thermal behavior.
- Displays SOC and temperature changes on a scope.
